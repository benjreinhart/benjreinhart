### Hellooo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer and open source contributor with over 14 years of experience. I spend most of my time hacking on projects involving AI, cryptography, and distributed systems. I also happen to be a bigggg fan of Elixir, Erlang, and graph databases.

Currently, I'm cofounder and CTO of Axilla ([website](https://axilla.io), [github](https://github.com/axilla-io)).

Some recent projects of mine:

* Everything at [@axilla-io](https://github.com/axilla-io).
* A modern [TypeScript implementation](https://github.com/privy-io/shamir-secret-sharing) for Shamir Secret Sharing
* A [library](https://github.com/benjreinhart/secure-password-utilities) to securely generate passwords, passphrases, pins, and more
* A robust and efficient [decoder and encoder](https://github.com/benjreinhart/ex_kdl) for the KDL Document Language written in Elixir
* An [web application](https://github.com/benjreinhart/rayven) for securely sharing secrets

Once upon a time I had a [popular library](https://github.com/benjreinhart/react-native-aws3) React Native and AWS S3 uploads.
