### Hellooo üëã

I'm a software engineer and open source contributor. I spend most of my time hacking on projects involving AI, cryptography, and distributed systems. ‚ù§Ô∏è TypeScript & Elixir

Currently, I'm cofounder and CTO of Axilla ([website](https://axilla.io), [github](https://github.com/axilla-io)). I was previously the first hire at [Privy](https://privy.io), working on authentication and end-to-end encryption APIs for data privacy. Before that, I was the tech lead for the data management platform at [Cruise](https://getcruise.com), which hosts the data used to train and evaluate models that drive cars.

Some recent projects of mine:

* Everything at [@axilla-io](https://github.com/axilla-io).
* A modern [TypeScript implementation](https://github.com/privy-io/shamir-secret-sharing) for Shamir Secret Sharing
* A [library](https://github.com/benjreinhart/secure-password-utilities) to securely generate passwords, passphrases, pins, and more
* A robust and efficient [decoder and encoder](https://github.com/benjreinhart/ex_kdl) for the KDL Document Language written in Elixir
* An [web application](https://github.com/benjreinhart/rayven) for securely sharing secrets

Once upon a time I had a [popular library](https://github.com/benjreinhart/react-native-aws3) for 0-dependency, easy AWS S3 uploads in React Native.
